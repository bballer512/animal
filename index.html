        <p>The lion is a muscular, deep-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck and round ears. Its fur varies in colour from light buff to silvery grey, yellowish red and dark brown. The colours of the underparts are generally lighter. A new-born lion has dark spots, which fade as the cub reaches adulthood, although faint spots often may still be seen on the legs and underparts. The lion is the only member of the cat family that displays obvious sexual dimorphism. Males have broader heads and a prominent mane that grows downwards and backwards covering most of the head, neck, shoulders, and chest. The mane is typically brownish and tinged with yellow, rust and black hairs</p>

    <h2>Taxonomy and History</h2>
    <p> Felis leo was the scientific name used by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, who described the lion in his work Systema Naturae.The genus name Panthera was coined by German naturalist Lorenz Oken in 1816. Between the mid-18th and mid-20th centuries, 26 lion specimens were described and proposed as subspecies, of which 11 were recognised as valid in 2005. They were distinguished on the basis of appearance, size and colour of mane.
    <br>  
    <h3>Evolution</h3>
    <p>The lion's closest relatives are the other species of the genus Panthera, namely tiger, snow leopard, jaguar, and leopard. Results of phylogenetic studies published in 2006 and 2009 indicate that the jaguar and the lion belong to one sister group that diverged about 2.06 million years ago.Results of later studies indicate that the leopard and the lion belong to the same sister group, which diverged 3.1–1.95 million years ago. The geographic origin of the Panthera is most likely northern Central Asia. The leopard-lion clade was distributed in the Asian and African Palearctic since at least the Early Pliocene. The clade consisting of lion and Eurasian cave lion is thought to have diverged in Africa or Holarctic Asia, 2.93–1.23 million years ago. Hybridisation between lion and snow leopard ancestors, however, may have continued until about 2.1 million years ago.0 The Eurasian and American cave lions became extinct at the end of the last glacial period without mitochondrial descendants on other continents.</p>
    
        <p>The modern lion was probably widely distributed in Africa during the Middle Pleistocene and started to diverge in sub-Saharan Africa during the Late Pleistocene. Lion populations in East and Southern Africa became separated from populations in West and North Africa when the equatorial rainforest expanded 183,500–81,800 years ago. 
    
        <p>The expansion of the Sahara 83,100–26,600 years ago caused the separation of populations in West and North Africa. As the rainforest decreased, thus giving rise to more open habitats, lions moved from West to Central Africa. Lions from North Africa dispersed to southern Europe and Asia 38,800–8,300 ago. Extinction of lions in southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East interrupted gene flow between lion populations in Asia and Africa. Genetic evidence revealed numerous mutations in lion samples from East and Southern Africa, which indicates that this group has a longer evolutionary history than genetically less diverse lion samples from Asia and West and Central Africa. Results of phylogeographic research indicate that the two living lion subspecies diverged about 245,000 years ago.</p>

   <h3>Subspecies</h3>
    <br>   
 <p>P. l. leo (Linnaeus, 1758) − the nominate lion subspecies includes the Asiatic lion, the regionally extinct Barbary lion, and lion populations in West and northern parts of Central Africa. P. l. melanochaita (Smith, 1842) − includes the extinct Cape lion and lion populations in East and Southern African regions

<h2>Biology</h2>

    
    <h3>Anatomy</h3>
        <p>Male lions and female lions are similar in a lot of ways, one distinct difference separates them. The male lion has a large bushy mane that stretches from his head, down his neck and covers the beginning of his back. The mane ranges in colour, from light tan, dark brown to black. Because the mane is very thick, it helps the male lion when he is in conflict by protecting his neck and also makes him appear larger which can intimidate his competitor.</p>
        
        <p>The female (lioness) does not have a mane. She looks very much like a very large normal feline cat. The mane of a male lion is used to identify their strength. The bigger the mane, the stronger the lion.</p>

<h2>Behavior</h2>
        <p>Lions spend much of their time resting; they are inactive for about 20 hours per day. Although lions can be active at any time, their activity generally peaks after dusk with a period of socialising, grooming and defecating. Intermittent bursts of activity continue until dawn, when hunting most often takes place. They spend an average of two hours a day walking and 50 minutes eating.</p>
        
    <h3>Socialbility</h3>
    <p>The lion is the most social of all wild felid species, living in groups of related individuals with their offspring. Such a group is called a “pride”. Groups of male lions are called “coalitions”. Females form the stable social unit in a pride and do not tolerate outside females.Membership only changes with the births and deaths of lionesses</p>
    
        <h3>Sounds</h3>
     <p>The lion's repertoire of vocalisations is large; variations in intensity and pitch appear to be central to communication. Most lion vocalisations are variations of growling, snarling, meowing and roaring. Other sounds produced include purring, puffing, bleating and humming. Roaring is used to advertise its presence. Lions most often roar at night, a sound that can be heard from a distance of 5 miles. They tend to roar in a very characteristic manner starting with a few deep, long roars that subside into a series of shorter ones</p>
    
    <h3>Reproduction</h3>
        <p>Most lionesses reproduce by the time they are four years of age. Lions do not mate at a specific time of year and the females are polyestrous. A lioness may mate with more than one male when she is in heat.The female gives birth to a litter of between one and four cubs in a secluded den, which may be a thicket, a reed-bed, a cave, or some other sheltered area, usually away from the pride.</p>


<h2>Relationship with humans</h2>
<p>Lions are part of a group of exotic animals that have been central to zoo exhibits since the late 18th century. Although many modern zoos are more selective about their exhibits, there are more than 1,000 African and 100 Asiatic lions in zoos and wildlife parks around the world. Lion taming has been part of both established circuses and individual acts such as Siegfried & Roy. The practice began in the early 19th century by Frenchman Henri Martin and American Isaac Van Amburgh, who both toured widely and whose techniques were copied by a number of followers.</p>
